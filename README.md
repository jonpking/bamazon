#Bamazon

Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront that uses MySQL to store its inventory. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory using a CLI.

You can get started with this app by downloading the files found at https://github.com/jonpking/bamazon and then using npm to install the required packages.

Below you can find screenshots that will demonstrate the basic flow of the program.
